# Task: Represent functions with non-numerical parameters.

# Task 1: Define a function called first_element that takes in a list and outputs its first element.



# Task 2: Define a function called last_element that takes in a list and outputs its last element.



# Task 3: Define a function called first_last_sum that takes in a list and outputs the sum of
# the first and last element. The function should call the functions in tasks 1-2.



# Task 4: Define a function called distance_from_origin that takes in a tuple representing a point
# in the xy-coordinate plane and outputs its distance from the origin.



# Task 5: Define a function called distance_between that takes in two tuples representing points
# in the xy-coordinate plane and outputs their distance from each other.
