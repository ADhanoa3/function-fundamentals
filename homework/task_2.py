# Task: Represent common multi-variable mathematical functions in Python.

# Task 1: Define a function called average_value that takes in two numerical inputs and outputs their average.



# Task 2: Define a function called max_of_three that takes in three numerical inputs and outputs the maximum value.



# Task 3: Define a function called min_of_three that takes in three numerical inputs and outputs the minimum value.



# Task 4: Define a function called midrange that takes in three numerical inputs and outputs the average of the maximum
# and minimum values. This function should call the functions created in tasks 1 - 3.
